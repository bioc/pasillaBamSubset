Title: Subset of BAM files from "Pasilla" experiment
Description: Subset of BAM files untreated1.bam (single-end reads) and
	untreated3.bam (paired-end reads) from "Pasilla" experiment
	(Pasilla knock-down by Brooks et al., Genome Research 2011).
	See the vignette in the pasilla data package for how BAM files
	untreated1.bam and untreated3.bam were obtained from the RNA-Seq
	read sequence data that is provided by NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus
	under accession numbers GSM461176 to GSM461181.  Also contains
        the DNA sequence for fly chromosome 4 to which the reads can
        be mapped.
